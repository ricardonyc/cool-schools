## This project was built using React, TypeScript and CSS.

### What I learned:
- How to manage complex state logic using the ***useReducer*** hook
- How to use the ***useImperativeHandle*** hook to pass values from a child component back up to a Parent component using the ***useRef*** hook as well
- How to manage global states using the ***useContext*** hook (*for dark mode and pop ups*)
- Implementing TypeScript into React
- ðŸ”¥ Authenticating users using ***Firebase Authentication***
- ðŸ”¥ Storing user data using the ***Firestore Database***
- ðŸ”¥ Hosting the website using ***Firebase***

### Features I can (and most likely will) improve/add:
- Ability to add images along with review
- Implement ***Redux*** for state management
- Refactor the Login/Sign Up logic and combine the logic into one possibly using ***Redux*** or the ***useReducer*** hook
